This package is used to control the turtlesim simulation.

\section*{How to run\+:}

{\ttfamily roslaunch tsim trect.\+launch} -\/ It uses feedforward control to drive the turtle in a rectangle based on the parameters set in the yaml file. It also calculates and plots the positional error.

{\ttfamily roslaunch tsim turtle\+\_\+pent.\+launch} -\/ Drives the turtle in a pentagon using the Waypoints and Diff\+Drive classes from rigid2d.

{\ttfamily roslaunch tsim trutle\+\_\+odom.\+launch} -\/ Uses {\ttfamily fake\+\_\+diff\+\_\+encoders} and {\ttfamily odometer} nodes to control a diff drive robot in rviz to mimic the turtle. (This launch file includes {\ttfamily turtle\+\_\+pent.\+launch})
